## Music

-   I love listening to music anytime, my favirote genre of music is rock and my favorite band is The Beatles, their music can really help me to process all kinds of feelings
-   I'm not just listening to music, I can play guitar, bass, drums (not very good but OK) and Guzheng(A traditional Chinese instrument), and I have my own band 2 years ago and we played in school's stage, but it's disbanded now.

-   My favorite TV shows are The office and Modern Family and my favorite movie is Chungking Express.

## Photographs

-   I love document life with a camera
-   I'm better at landscapes than portraits and I like taking pictures of other people more than selfies
